== Devise/Omniauth/Facebook/Koala

Here is a teeny app to demonstrate Devise with Omniauth (using Facebook as a provider), which uses Koala to grab your friends and show them in a list.

To run this app, be sure to have your Facebook ID and Facebook Secret keys in your ENV hash, like so:

FACEBOOK_KEY=#
FACEBOOK_SECRET=#

One way to do this is to use Foreman. In development, put the above in a .env file in your root directory, and create an empty file called Procfile (or foreman will barf). Then run `foreman run rails server`
